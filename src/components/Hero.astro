    Iâ€™m on a journey to become a front-end web developer. I love building little
    projects, trying out new coding techniques, and sharing what I learn along
    the way. When Iâ€™m not at my desk, youâ€™ll find me reading, hiking through the
    mountains, or challenging myself on rock-climbing walls.

    I started this blog to document my progress, keep myself accountable, and
    hopefully inspire anyone else whoâ€™s learning to code. Welcome to my corner
    of the internet, and thanks for stopping by!
